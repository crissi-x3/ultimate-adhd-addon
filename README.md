You have 20 Browser Windows with 200 Tabs each? Your ADHD is taking over your life? This will try to help you organize your Browser


We know how ADHD is, so how knows if I will abbandon this project again, but I promise I will try - if mostly for my sake to be honest.

Uhm to tell you if this could help you, I will tell you what my general problem is, if it sounds relatable to you, this might be the right solution for you (also feel free to open issues if you have cool ideas):

So basically I go into episodes of finding stuff extremely interesting and then opening new tab after new tab - just to soon abbandon it
then I leave it open, becuase I think - if I leave it there for me to trip over it, it might remind me of that cool thing I researched back then and I will continue.

One day I might need it again, I cannot close it!!!

Well my Desktop now has 64GB of RAM - you can imagine why

one thing that actually helped me to some extent is an addon called "onetab". I wil definitely let myself be inspired by that one.

Basically it just closes all tabs and saves them in a new tab (that belongs to the addon) in which you can sort them to your liking and the nice thing is that you can just reopen all tabs with one click too!

Another thing I wanna do, if I come around to it is to basically help me create better youtube-playlists for myself. I feel extremely underwhelmed by the inability to do things like "sort a playlist by video length" or "watch all videos of a creator that I haven't watched yet", but maybe that's just me.

So now onto trying to figure out how to write a Firefox Addon...
